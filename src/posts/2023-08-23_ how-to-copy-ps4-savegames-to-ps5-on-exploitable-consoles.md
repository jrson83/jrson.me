Following the release of
[libhijacker](https://github.com/illusion0001/libhijacker) by
[illusion](https://twitter.com/illusion0002/) and the fact that it is now
possible to play Bloodborne (and other titles) at 60 FPS on PS5, here is a short
tutorial on how to get your Bloodborne savegame copied from an exploitable PS4
to an exploitable PS5. The tutorial is based on a short tutorial that
[illusion](https://twitter.com/illusion0002/) published on his Discord.

> I can't tell at the moment if it's possible to transfer a savegame created
> with a different CUSA than the CUSA version of the game installed on the PS5
> console. On my PS4 I played with a fpkg I created from the same original EU
> disc version I installed on the PS5.

If you don't know a game CUSA id, you can use
[Apollo Save Tool](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-ps4) to receive it, or
search for it on [orbispatches.com](https://orbispatches.com) or
[prosperopatches.com](https://prosperopatches.com/).

In the guide we learned how to copy PS4 savegames to PS5 on exploitable
consoles. Now run Bloodborne on your PS5 and the PS4 Bloodborne character should
be loaded.

> It didn't work for me the first time I tried it and on PS5 it loaded the
> original game state. On the second try it worked. It is not necessary to
> resign the savegame with Apollo after the import, because this corrupts the
> savegame.
