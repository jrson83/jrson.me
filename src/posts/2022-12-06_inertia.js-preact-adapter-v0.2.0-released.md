I've been following [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) development for quite
some time now and was very hyped at the beginning of the year, with the release
of the first publicly available
[SSR adapter](https://inertiajs.com/server-side-rendering).

Based on the
[Inertia.js React Adapter](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/tree/master/packages/react),
I released the initial version of the
[Inertia.js Preact Adapter](https://github.com/jrson83/inertia-preact) and a
Preact variant of the
[Ping CRM demo](https://github.com/jrson83/pingcrm-preact).

Since then, not much has happened at Intertia.js. Besides numerous unanswered
issues and pull requests, there is a
[statement from developer Jonathan Reinink](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/issues/1240),
who explains his philosophy on the project.

## Laravel 9 compatibility

Looking at the development of Laravel, on the other hand, a lot has happened.
The biggest change in the last versions is the replacement of
[Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Although it's currently hard to be more specific about the future of Inertia.js,
I decided to release a new version of the
[Preact Adapter](https://github.com/jrson83/inertia-preact). Additionally I have
updated the Preact variant of the
[Ping CRM demo](https://github.com/jrson83/pingcrm-preact) with some
optimizations.

## What the docs...?

The [Inertia.js documentation](https://inertiajs.com/) is out of date. Pull
requests with updated installation details are not answered nor accepted. Some
of them are breaking changes. To simplify the installation of the Preact
Adapter, an up-to-date, detailed installation guide will be provided here soon.
Additionally there will be a Laravel preset for the adapter available soon.
