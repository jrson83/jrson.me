Earlier this week, PS5Scene developer Euro Ali published some information regarding his concept of modifying the bd-j runtime to run existing bd-j exploits without a Blu-ray writer.
> The target is to run exploits using only a Blu-ray drive, without the need for a web browser, no need for a Blu-ray writer.

Later he stated:

> PS4 and PS5 use the bdjstack.jar loader to load bd-j content while running java, applying bytecode injection to this loader gives it a lot of functionality such as executing jar without writing Blu-ray, starting a web server, etc.

Currently, BDJPlus has the following requirements:

- PS5 with BD-Drive
- Firmware 3.00 - 4.03
- A legit BD-J supported disc (we used Warcraft: The Beginning)
- FTPS5 with `MTRW` ([SiSTR0](https://github.com/SiSTR0/FTPS5) or [EchoStretch](https://github.com/EchoStretch/FTPS5))

And the following features:

- Web server, hosted on the PS5 (including jar loader & log reader) can host any content
- Offers both [BD-JB](https://github.com/sleirsgoevy/bd-jb/tree/ps5) & Self Hosted [WebKit](https://github.com/Cryptogenic/PS5-IPV6-Kernel-Exploit) JB
- Both exploits can be applied offline
- Exploit can be updated easily with FTP
- It is possible to develop own modules

To get more in detail:

- `bdjstack_kernel.jar` - Allows sending system notification
- `bdjstack_webserver.jar` - Creates web server, content getting from www
- `bdjstack_injector.jar` - Pressing LEFT, LEFT, SQUARE, RIGHT, RIGHT injects `inject/000000.jar`

I had the opportunity to test BDJPlus on my PS5 (fw 3.20) and published a video for demonstration. Euro Ali will publish BDJPlus when it is done, including more features.
